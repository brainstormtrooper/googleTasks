===========

Google Tasks backend for GTG (that really works)

This backend works with the curent GTG version (0.3.1).

It polls all tasklists and applies tags to the tasks in the form of "gtl_tasklistname".

Tasks can be created on any tasklist by applying the appropriate tag to the new task in GTG - gtl_whatevertasklistyouwant... provided the list exists. If the list doesn't exist, the task is created on the default list.
